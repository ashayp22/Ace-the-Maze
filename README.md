# WWDC2020
My submission to the WWDC 2020 Swift Student Challenge

An interactive maze solvable using block code, targeting towards young students that are learning computer science and coding for the first time. The goal of the maze is to collect soap and a mask and then beat the COVID-19 character. At the end, there's even tips on coding and staying healthy!
